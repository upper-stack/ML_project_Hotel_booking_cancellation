## ML_project_Hotel_booking_cancellation
A significant number of hotel bookings are called off due to cancellations or no-shows. Typical reasons for cancellations include change of plans, scheduling conflicts, etc. This is often made easier by the option to do so free of charge or preferably at a low cost. This may be beneficial to hotel guests, but it is a less desirable and possibly revenue-diminishing factor for hotels to deal with. Such losses are particularly high on last-minute cancellations.

The new technologies involving online booking channels have dramatically changed customersâ€™ booking possibilities and behavior. This adds a further dimension to the challenge of how hotels handle cancellations, which are no longer limited to traditional booking and guest characteristics.

This pattern of cancellations of bookings impacts a hotel on various fronts:

- Loss of resources (revenue) when the hotel cannot resell the room.
- Additional costs of distribution channels by increasing commissions or paying for publicity to help sell these rooms.
- Lowering prices last minute, so the hotel can resell a room, resulting in reducing the profit margin.
- Human resources to make arrangements for the guests.

### Objective

This increasing number of cancellations could call for a Machine Learning based solution that can help in predicting which booking is likely to be canceled. INN Hotels Group has a chain of hotels in Portugal - they are facing problems with this high number of booking cancellations and have reached out to your firm for data-driven solutions. As a data scientist, I set out to analyse the data provided to find which factors have a high influence on booking cancellations, build a predictive model that can predict which booking will be cancelled in advance to help formulate profitable policies for cancellations and refunds.
